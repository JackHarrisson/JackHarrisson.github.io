        <h1 class="text-center">Terms Of Engagement</h1>
        <div class="terms-of-engagement-content">
            <p>The lawyer-client relationship is one of mutual trust and respect and it is important that you, the client, and we, your legal advisers, each know and understand clearly what will be expected of us and the duties, rights and responsibilities upon which our relationship will be based.</p>

            <h2>Letter Of Engagement</h2>

            <p>All client services will be provided pursuant to a letter of engagement which will be supplied prior to or at the commencement of any services provided, which will tell you what services we have agreed to provide for you, who of personnel will provide those services and what those services will cost.</p>

            <h2>Terms Of Engagement</h2>

            <p>These Standard Terms of Engagement (“Terms”) apply in respect of all work carried out by us for you, except to the extent that we otherwise agree with you in writing.</p>

            <h2>1. Services</h2>

            <p>1.1 The services which we are to provide for you are set out in our Engagement Letter.</p>

            <h2>2. Fees and Disbursements</h2>

            <p>2.1 The fees which we will charge or the manner in which they will be arrived at, are set out in our Engagement Letter.</p>

            <p>2.2 If the Engagement Letter specifies a fixed fee, we will charge this for the agreed scope of our services. Work which falls outside that scope will be charged on an hourly rate basis. We will advise you as soon as reasonably practicable if it becomes necessary for us to provide services outside the agreed scope and if requested, give you an estimate of the likely amount of the further costs.</p>

            <p>2.3 Where our fees are calculated on an hourly basis, the hourly rates are set out in our Engagement Letter. The differences in those rates reflect the experience and specialisation of our professional staff. An additional fee for urgency and/or complexity of the matter may be charged.</p>

            <p>2.4 In providing services we may incur disbursements or have to make payments to third parties on your behalf. These will be included in our invoice to you when the expense is incurred. We may require an advance payment for the disbursements or expenses which we will be incurring on your behalf.</p>

            <p>2.5 GST is payable by you on our fees and disbursements.</p>

            <h2>3. Payment of Fees and Disbursements</h2>

            <p>3.1 Our fees and disbursements are to be paid within 14 days of the date of the invoice unless alternative arrangements have been made with us.</p>

            <p>3.2 Our final account will be sent to you shortly after we have completed your matter.</p>

            <p>3.3 We do however issue interim accounts where that is appropriate.</p>

            <p>3.4 You authorise us to deduct our fees from funds held in our trust account on your behalf.</p>

            <p>3.5 We may ask you to pay fees in advance, but in those instances, your payment will be held in our trust account and only paid to us by deduction when an account has been forwarded to you.</p>

            <p>3.6 Interest will accrue on unpaid accounts at the rate of 15% per annum as from the due date until payment. Other action to recover unpaid fees may also be taken and the cost of such recovery may be added to the account payable by you.</p>

            <p>3.7 Although you may expect to be reimbursed by a third party for our fees and expenses, and although our invoices may at your request or with your approval be directed to a third party, nevertheless you remain responsible for payment to us if the third party fails to pay us.</p>

            <h2>4. Suspension of Services</h2>

            <p>4.1 We reserve the right to cease working on the matter if interim accounts are not paid on time or request for information or action remains unsatisfied.</p>

            <h2>5. Privacy and Confidentiality</h2>

            <p>5.1 We will treat all information we hold about you as private and confidential and will not disclose any information we hold on your behalf or about you unless we are required to do so by law or where it is necessary to do so to provide our services to you or when requested by you or with your consent.</p>

            <h2>6. Retention of Files and Documents</h2>

            <p>6.1 You authorise us (without further reference to you) to destroy all files and documents for this matter (other than any documents that we hold in safe custody for you) 7 years after our engagement ends, or earlier if we have converted those files and documents to an electronic format.</p>

            <h2>7. Conflicts of Interest</h2>

            <p>7.1 We have procedures in place to identify and respond to conflicts of interest. If a conflict of interest arises we will advise you of this and follow the requirements and procedures set out in the Law Society's Rules of Conduct and Client Care for Lawyers.</p>

            <h2>8. Duty of Care</h2>

            <p>8.1 Our duty of care is to you and not to any other person. Before any other person may rely on our advice, we must expressly agree to this.</p>

            <h2>9. Trust Account</h2>

            <p>9.1 We maintain a trust account for all funds which we receive from clients (except monies received for payment of our invoices). If we are holding significant funds on your behalf we will normally lodge those funds on interest bearing deposit with a bank. We do not charge an administration fee for this service.</p>

            <h2>10. Termination</h2>

            <p>10.1 You are entitled to terminate your instructions to us upon giving us reasonable notice.</p>

            <p>10.2 We may terminate the retainer if there is good cause, such as you not providing us with instructions in a sufficiently timely way or your unwillingness, inability or failure to pay our fees on an agreed basis, or, except in litigation matters, you adopting against our advice a course of action which we believe is highly imprudent and may be inconsistent with our fundamental obligations as lawyers.</p>

            <p>10.3 If we terminate this retainer we will give you reasonable notice so that you can arrange alternative representation and we shall give you reasonable assistance to find another lawyer.</p>

            <p>10.4 Our fees for services reasonably and properly provided to you prior to the termination of retainer shall be paid by you prior to uplifting your records and we may retain copies of your documents and records.</p>

            <h2>11. General</h2>

            <p>11.1 These Terms apply to any current engagement and also to any future engagement, whether or not we send you another copy of them.</p>

            <p>11.2 We are entitled to change these Terms from time to time, in which case we will send you amended Terms.</p>

            <p>11.3 Our relationship with you is governed by New Zealand law and New Zealand Courts have non-exclusive jurisdiction.</p>

Except in certain circumstances specified in the Lawyers & Conveyancers Act 2006 the Fidelity Fund does not cover a client for any loss relating to money that a lawyer is instructed to invest on behalf of the client.</p>

            <h2>4. Complaints</h2>
